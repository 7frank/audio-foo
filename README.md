# what is this?

- WIP -

This is somewhat of an audio tool, that extracts certain instruments from a song

Until now it slices the fist 5 seconds of a song and runs the result through the extraction process

## user stories

- As a customer I want to test the website with reduced functionality before i buy anything, to find out if this is useful for me

- As customer I do not want to register but login with google facebook or github, because registration is tedious
- As a entrepreneur I need a simple setup to let my user pay for additional functionality
- As entrepreneur i want to have a bare bone application that provides
  - authn
  - payment
  - payment2authz
  - canceling subscriptions => revoke AuthZ

# technical overview

The idea is to have a modular application.

- behind a reverse proxy like traefik
  - Note:https://chat.openai.com/c/78b14b35-f3d5-4770-a6cd-09988a221019
- aa AuthN traefik middleware
- a potential stripe traefik middleware / or module (currently payment-module)
- a mechanism that assigns or revokes privileges to sso users based on subscription
  - stripe products can contain metadata, a field roles/privileges could be added whose content would allow to set roles/privileges
    - Note: this does not work for payment intents for subscriptions as metadata is not allowed there atm (mai/23)
